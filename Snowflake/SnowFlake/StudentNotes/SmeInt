Normalization in DBMS: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF in Database

Normalization is a process of organizing the data in database to avoid data redundancy, insertion anomaly, update anomaly & deletion anomaly. 

Here are the most commonly used normal forms:

First normal form(1NF) : As per the rule of first normal form, an attribute (column) of a table cannot hold multiple values. It should hold only atomic values.


Second normal form(2NF) : A table is said to be in 2NF if both the following conditions hold: 1) Table is in 1NF (First normal form)
																		   2) No non-prime attribute is dependent on the proper subset of any candidate key of table.

Third normal form(3NF) : A table design is said to be in 3NF if both the following conditions hold: 1) Table must be in 2NF
																			   2) Transitive functional dependency of non-prime attribute on any super key should be removed.

Boyce & Codd normal form (BCNF) : It is an advance version of 3NF thatâ€™s why it is also referred as 3.5NF. BCNF is stricter than 3NF. A table complies with BCNF if it is in 3NF and for every functional dependency X->Y, X should be the super key of the table.
