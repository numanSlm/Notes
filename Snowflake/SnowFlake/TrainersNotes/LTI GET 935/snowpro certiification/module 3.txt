SESSION 3--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Snowflake Web UI consists of Ribbon layer consists of databases,shares,marketplace,warehouse,worksheet,History

5 default roles are created by Snowflake:
a)Accountadmin
b)SECURITYADMIN
c)Systemadmin
d)Public
e)Customroles
f)User admin 

1 user for an account gets Sysadmin role

Context : ROle being used , Db , Schema

The user administrator (USERADMIN) role includes the privileges to create and manage users and roles (assuming ownership of those roles or users has not been transferred to another role).

The security administrator (i.e users with the SECURITYADMIN system role) role includes the global MANAGE GRANTS privilege to grant or revoke privileges on objects in the account. 
The USERADMIN role is a child of this role in the default access control hierarchy.

The system administrator (SYSADMIN) role includes the privileges to create warehouses, databases, and all database objects (schemas, tables, etc.).

By default, when your account is provisioned, the first user is assigned the ACCOUNTADMIN role. This user should then create one or more
Additional users who are assigned the USERADMIN role. All remaining users should be created by the user(s) with the USERADMIN role.

Can create custom roles
1)Accountadmin
2)Securityadmin
3)Sysadmin



Snowflake storage
Account 
Database
Schema can have multiple objects


Apart from micropartitions snowflake stores the following contents in the table:
METADATA CACHE[CLOUD SERVICES LAYER]-Help in Query Optimization
---------------------------------------------------------------
1)Number of Micropartitions
2)Max-Minvalue of each Micropartitions-Zone maps
3)Number of rows
4)Cardinality of each columns
5)Number of Null values

Pruning means cutting unwanted stuff
Horizontal Pruning -- WHERE CLAUSE(Slicing)
------------------
which micropartitioning satisfying the query[where condition or predicate]
The processing of reading the micropartitions satisfying the query is called as Horizontal Pruning
[ELiminatiing the micropartitions not satisfying the queries is known as Horizontal Pruning]

NO specific distribution keys but can sort while using copy into command 

Vertical Pruning -- (SELECT (Slicing))
-----------------
This Pruning happens inside a micropartition

Snowflake stores data in columnar fashion so its not row oriented 
Process of getting only cols required for the query like (select statement inside partition)


In a row oriented row level lot of overhead through each row.

Q1)Does Snowflake store any other type of data apart from the warehouse data?
a)True
b)False[Ans is false]Metadata is also stored moslty in cloud services layer

What micropartitions need to be picked up is done through the metadata cache

Storage
--------
reorganizes data in internal,columnar,compressed format storing in cloud storage.

SF manages all aspects of how data is stored:
the organization
file structure
size,compression,metadata,statistics

a)Micropartitions are immutable
b)Compressed size 16MB(uncompressed range from 50-500mb)
c)Data at rest is encrypted
d)Storage cost - $23/TB/Month in compressed data[Depemds on accoun ttype like on demand or no]
e)Horizontal pruning - Micro Partitions
f)Continuous availability - 99.99% data availability and 99.99999999% durability

Snowflake Storage
------------------

Tables ------ a)Permanent Tables - Time travel = 0/90{defa or fail safe is for a week[7 days] -- enterprise but 0/1 timetravel[Retention period]
				For permanent tables fail safe is 7 days irrespective of any edition
			  b)Temporary Tables-Session oriented-time travel{0/1} and no fail safe-can be used for moving permanent data from one permanent table
				to another with some transformation within the table-No storage costs 
			  c)Transient Tables-Permanent type -timetravel{0/1} no FailSafe for transient(Comprehensive Data Protection)
			  d)External Tables-No time travel and fail safe- stored in external stages-are read only and great for semi-structured type-no cloning
					DDL:SQL works : select,agregations,Joins
			  
Views --------- a)Standard Views
				b)Secure Views
				c)Materialized Views
				
Stages -------- a)Table stage
				b)User Stage
				c)Named Stage   - named Internal stage
								  named External stage
	
CDP -Comprehensive Data Protection
----------------------------------
How well we have our data protected
Features
a)Time-Travel-Enables instant rollback to any point in time during chosen retention window.
Snowflake stores snapshot of data in the table 
(select * from table_name at(timestamp=> "Mon :: timestamp_tz)
select * from table_name at(offset=> 60*5)[seconds]
select * from table_name before(statement=> "sdopsodpspspsp")---Every query has a statement identifier.

Default time travel for any table is 1.

How much can we go back is called Data retention period.
								 ------------------------
Higher the retention cost higher the cost so it consumes more time.


								 
Permanent Enterprise account = 90 days(3 months)--Time travel
Here max is 90 and it can vary from table to tables.
Here u can define when you create the tables.
Standard account = 1 day								 
								 
								 
b)FailSafe	{Used in case of disaster}
Only snowflake can do it users cannot do manually employers will do for us				
-Protection against infrastructure and failures
-Protection against corruption and user errors
-Long-term data protection
