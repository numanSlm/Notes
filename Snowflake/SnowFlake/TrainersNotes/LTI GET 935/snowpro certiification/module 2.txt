SESSION 2------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No users concepts in Snowflake its only roles 
We have liberty to choose virtual warehouses
In every database we have 2 schemas by default:PUBLIC SCHEMA(COMES BY DEFAULT) and INFORMATION SCHEMA(all metadata of tables,views) MYSCHEMA : CUSTOM SCHEMA

Storage,Virtual Processing and Metadata

Nodes will share data but virtual warehouse will not share data

Virtual Warehouse
-----------------
Can cosist of 1 or more clusters

Multi-cluster warehouse is supported by Enterprise,Enterprise+-Buisness critical and VPS-Virtual Private Snowflake(Check docs)

Unique identifier Account-> Virtual Warehouse(No limit)-> compute consisting of clusters [each cluster of same size] 
suspend to hibernate[warehouse] autoresume 

Scaling policy[policy for startup and shutdownof clusters]

1 credit = 4 dollars[in enterprise]
octa core processor 200gb hardisk and 20GB ram -  

Snowflake Architecture uses a Top down Approach -- Sending signals to Virtual Warehouse


Snowflake supports ACID properties
Snapshot , MVCC {Concurrency Control} Locks ===== 

Metadata{Global services},Processing,Storage
Snowflake enforces null constraint all the other constraints like Primary key , Foreign key are not enforced but it supports them.

Objects at Account Level:
Users
Role
Warehouse
Shared Objects
Network Policies
Reader Account
Masking Policy Objects
Account Level parameters
Integration Objects

Snowflake supports read committed isolation.[ISOLATION LEVEL SUPPORTED IN SNOWFLAKE] - others not supported are dirty read not supported yet
You will only read committed data 

Q1)Which best describes snowflake table?
a)Conceptual instance in the storage layer
b)Logical objects in the storage layer
c)Cluster key used for optimizing query performance
d)Logical grouping of columns and rows - underlying physical data [Ans is d]


Q2)SF Architecture is designed for which of the following?
a)Hadoop
b)Hive
c)Cloud [Ans is cloud]

Q3)WHat best describes SF?
a)Concurrent
b)Performant
c)Simplicity
d)All of the above [Ans is d]

Q4)Data migration is not applicable on ?
a)Databases
b)SCHEMA
c)Indexes
d)Build data pipelines Ans is [INDEXES](because snowflake doesnt support indexes)
Oracle to snowflake

Q5)What is the largest size of micropartitions?
a)16MB compressed
b)32MB compressed
c)48MB compressed
d)64MB compressed [Ans is a]
uncompressed is between 50 to 500 MB

Q6)Warehouse can be resized when warehouse is running?
a)True
b)False [ Ans is true]Existing query cannot take any advantage

Q7)Can warehouse be stopped when resizing?
a)True
b)False [ans is true]

Q8)Can schema be part of multiple database objects?
a)true
b)False[ans is true]

Q9)By what factor does the number of servers increase when scaling up?
a)1
b)2
c)4
d)8[ans is 2]

Q10)Changing the warehouse size from small to large will help in ?
a)Concurrency
b)Performance(Ans is b) [increase the size is performance -- scale up and increase the cluster the scale out --- concurrency]

Remember increase the warehouse size is scale up increasing the warehouse performance and number of cluster is concurrency scale out
Increase the throughput create bigger clusters[Increase the performance basically][increase the number of actions per time]
Increase the response time increase the number of clusters [Response time] [concurrency][increase the response time]
Concurrency = Throughput * latency
Scale up = Increase size =  Increase throughput = increase query performance[fast] = Increase number of actions per time.
Scale out = Increase number of clusters = Increase latency = increase response time  = Decrease queueing = Increase concurrency


Scale up for performance[Throughput single query will benefit]
-------------------------
Scaling up to Add - CPU,RAM,SSD
- Scale for larger data volumes and complex queries
- Wont help concurrency
- Availability of parallel files necessary for parrallelism
- Match query profile with warehouse size

Scale out for concurrency -[Small small multiple queries]
- Add multiple compute cluster for concurrency min 1 to max 10
-Auto scale out and scale in
- Queries distributed among the clusters

Queue = problem with the concurrency[Multiple users are firing multiple queries]--Solution


Q11)WHich of the following cannot be recovered with Time Travel?
a)Databases
b)Tables
c)Schemas
d)Stages [Ans is stages]

Q12)JDBC and ODBC are drivers present. DO you still need to connect a Snowflake driver to connect to Snowflake?
a)True
b)False [Ans is False]

Q13)Virtual warehouse is a part of which layer?
a)Storage layer
b)Compute layer
c)Cloud services layer
d)Database layer 
[Ans  is Compute]

Q14)The global services layer has access to all the metadata and statistics stored in it?
a)True
b)False
 [Ans is true]
 
Q15)Hierarchy of tables
a)Account>>Database>>Schema>>Tables
b)Database>>Schema>>Table>>Account
c)Schema>>Database>>Table>>Account
d)Account>>Schema>>Database>>Table[Ans is a]

Q16)Which of the following are multi-tenant services?
a)Metadata
b)Query processing
c)Storage[Ans is a and c because these services are spread across multiple users]All the customers will have the data in cloud storage or S3.storage and metadata are shared but
virtual warehosue is not shared

Q17)Which of the following services are ephemeral?[Not long lasting]
a)Metadata
b)Query Processing
c)Storage[Ans is b query processsing u cannot auto suspend storage and metadata but virtual warehouse can be suspended opposite of above question]


Q18)Snowflake is a packaged software that can be installed by a user?
a)True
b)False[Ans is False]

Q19)A snowflake account can be spanned across multiple regions
a)True
b)False[ANs is false]

Q20)A snowflake account can be spanned across multiple cloud vendors
a)True
b)False[Ans is False]

Q21)Query Processing happens in Metadata layer
a)True
b)False[Ans is False]

Q22)Virtual warehouse share resources among each other
a)True
b)False[Ans is false]

Q23)Storage is tightly coupled with Compute in Snowflake
a)True
b)False[Ans is false]

Q24)Query parsing and optimization occurs in which layer.
a)metadata
b)Virtual Processing
c)storage[Ans is metadata]

Q25Micro partitions can be accessed directly by the customer(without SQL)
a)True
b)False[Ans is False]

MICRO PARTITIONS is a physical files in S3 bucket
