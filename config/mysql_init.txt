# MYSQL Debian Installation (Pair with Dbeaver)
sudo apt install mysql-server

systemctl status mysql

mysql_secure_installation

#open new terminal 

killall -9 mysql_secure_installation

Open the terminal application.
Terminate the mysql_secure_installation from another terminal using the killall command:
sudo killall -9 mysql_secure_installation
Start the mysql client:
sudo mysql
Run the following SQL query:

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'SetRootPasswordHere';
exit

Then run the following command to secure it:
sudo mysql_secure_installation
When promoted for the password enter the SetRootPasswordHere (or whatever you set when you ran the above SQL query)
That is all.
